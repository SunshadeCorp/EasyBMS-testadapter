# EasyBMS Testadapter
PCB of the EasyBMS testadapter for end of line test as an EAGLE project

Used design rules from [here](https://github.com/JLCPCB/jlcpcb-eagle) with one modification: under "Masks" in DRC settings, set "Limit" to 20mil to cover vias that have smaller drill size with solder mask.
